\subsection{The Prover-Verifier Model}
Before we talk about the specifics of proofs we first have to define our setting. In our setting we have two kinds of actors, \emph{provers} and \emph{verifiers}.

A verifier is a party who wishes to know something about our blockchain. It's assumed it doesn't have network access (i.e. it can't be a full node). A verifier can be thought of as a Turing Machine which takes one or more proofs as input, and then determines whether a predicate is true or not. The only information the verifier knows is the genesis id of the chain it wants to decide predicates on.

Provers are parties with access to the Bitcoin network, the longest chain and all the transactions. They wish to communicate to the verifier and convince them about a predicate.

We distinguish provers as honest and malicious. An honest prover will generate proofs which are true according to the state of the chain he is aware of. A malicious prover may try to submit false proofs in order to gain some advantage. For example, a verifier may be a merchant, who, upon confirming that his client, Bob, has paid for a product will ship it to them. In this case it is in the best interest of Bob to submit a malicious proof which makes it appear like he has paid for the product when in reality he has not.

\subsection{Single-Prover Proofs}
There are many interesting statements a verifier can be certain about by utilizing only a single prover. We say that a chain is \textit{valid} iff it is structurally sound, which we also call \textit{traversable}.

\subsubsection{Chain Validity Proof}
Suppose we have a chain $\chain$ and we wish to prove to the verifier that it is a valid chain. It is easy to do this by supplying the whole chain to the verifier, who can sequentially, starting from the newest block, verify that the previous block hashes to the hash found on the newest block's \textsf{previd}. The process can be repeated until the genesis block is reached where the verifier can accept the chain as valid.

\subsubsection{Transaction Inclusion In Selected Block Proof}
If we have a transaction $tx$ which we wish to prove exists in a block $B$, then we can just generate a Merkle proof for the inclusion of the transaction's id. Given $B$, $tx$ and the Merkle proof, the verifier can then verify the Merkle proof against the Merkle tree root inside the header of $B$ to confirm that $tx \in B$.

\subsubsection{Transaction Inclusion In A Valid Chain Proof}
In order to prove that a transaction $tx$ is included in some valid chain we can very easily combine the above proofs. Suppose that $tx \in B$. Then by providing a chain validity proof for the chain that contains $B$ and a transaction inclusion proof for $B$, the verifier can accept if and only if both proofs are valid and the chain provided includes $B$.

It is important to note that our definition of validity is less strict than a full node's definition of validity. As a full node, it is possible to check that every transaction in a block is valid, and if and only if this is true, and the block is well-formed and valid under Proof-of-Work consider a block valid.

\subsection{Multi-Prover Proofs}
However, while a single prover is enough for some types of proofs, some are impossible to achieve without multiple provers. For example, convincing a verifier that we hold the longest Bitcoin chain would be impossible to do, because a prover could very easily be malicious and present a shorter chain. Without taking extra input from other provers and assuming that there exists at least one honest prover, it is impossible for a verifier to be certain. Those are two assumptions we will make for the following proofs.

\subsubsection{Longest Chain Proof}
Suppose we have a chain $\chain$ and we wish to prove to the verifier that it is the longest chain. We submit the whole chain to the prover, as do the rest of the provers. The verifier then verifies each given chain for validity and discards any invalid chains. For the remaining chains it compares them and keeps the longest one.

\subsubsection{Transaction Inclusion In The Longest Chain}
As previously, suppose $tx \in B$. We provide the whole chain, along with the Merkle proof for $tx \in B$. The verifier collects proofs of this kind and selects the longest valid chain. Then for all transaction inclusion proofs taken it checks whether the claimed block is included in the longest chain and the transaction inclusion proof is valid. If there is at least one transaction inclusion proof satisfying this requirement then the transaction is accepted, otherwise it is rejected.

Verifying this kind of proof is very similar to the operations a lite node does to verify transactions claimed to be on the longest chain that we viewed in Section \ref{subsec:spv}, which is why these proofs are called SPV proofs. These proofs are all linear in the size of the chain.

\subsection{Sublinear SPV}
We would like to be able to prove statements like:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We have a valid chain where the last $k$ blocks are the ones we're claiming. This is called a \textbf{suffix proof}.
  \item We have a valid chain where a specific given block is included. This is called an \textbf{infix proof}.
\end{itemize}

Our current best solution, SPV, requires providing the whole chain's block headers as proof. This is obviously linear in the size of the chain.

There have been previous attempts to create proofs smaller in size than SPV proofs~\cite{KLS}, where a scheme for logarithmic proofs was proposed.  This scheme was later proven insecure~\cite{nipopows}.

NIPoPoWs is the first secure construction~\cite{nipopows} for logarithmic proofs.

\subsection{Assumptions}
An assumption NIPoPoWs make is that the difficulty is constant. This is not true for Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.

NIPoPoWs also assume each block contains an interlink data structure, which we'll study shortly. Interlinks too don't exist in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.

In the next section we'll look at how we sidestep all those issues.

\subsection{Levels}
At the heart of the primitive lies the separation of blocks into levels. The level of a block is defined as $\textit{level}(B) = \left \lfloor \log(T) - \log(\sf{id}(B)) \right \rfloor$, where $T$ is the constant difficulty of the blockchain. The genesis block is an exception to this rule as $\textit{level}(Gen) = \infty$. We call a block of level $\mu$ a $\mu$-superblock.

Intuitively, the level of a block is the number of leading zeros of the binary representation of the block id when left padded to the length of $T$. An example of this can be seen on Table~\ref{table:level-counting}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    $T$ & 1110000 \\
    \hline
    $\sf{id}(B)$ & \underline{000}1000 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Calculating the level of a block by counting the leading zeros (3 in this case).}
  \label{table:level-counting}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:hierarchy} shows an example the implied blockchain created from the superblocks.

  \label{fig:hierarchy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Notation}
The NIPoPoWs paper introduces some notation for talking about blockchains with levels which we'll be using extensively. The notation is widely influenced by Python. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\chain$ denotes a blockchain, with $\chain[0]$ being the genesis block, $\chain[k]$ being the $k$-th first block and $\chain[-k]$ being the $k$-th last block.
  \item $\chain[k:]$ denotes the sub-blockchain starting from the $k$-th block, $\chain[-k:]$ denotes the sub-blockchain starting from the $k$-th last block.
  \item $\chain[:k]$ denotes the sub-blockchain ending before the $k$-th block, $\chain[:-k]$ denotes the sub-blockchain ending before the $k$-th last block.
  \item $\chain[i:j]$ denotes the sub-blockchain starting from the $i$-th block and ending at the $j$-th block. $i$ and $j$ can also be negative numbers similar to above.
  \item $\chain\{B:\}$ denotes the sub-blockchain starting from the block with block id $B$.
  \item $\chain\upchain^\mu$ denotes the sub-blockchain of $\chain$ where all blocks are of level $\mu$ or higher.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interlink}
Instead of keeping only the hash of the previous block inside the block header, for every superblock level we keep a pointer to the most recent superblock of that level. The structure containing these pointers is called the interlink. Bitcoin does not support such a structure in the block header but we will study how to sidestep this issue by velvet forking in a few sections.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    Level & Block \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $C[-2]$ \\
    $1$ & $C[-2]$ \\
    $2$ & $C[-4]$ \\
    $3$ & $C[-8]$ \\
    $\infty$ & $C[0]$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Interlink of $C[-1]$ from Figure~\ref{fig:hierarchy}}
  \label{table:interlink-example}
\end{table}

It's important to note that the interlink can be encoded as a series of block ids, starting from $0$ up to $\infty$. It can also be compressed by using this series as the leafs of a Merkle tree and taking the Merkle tree root.

Suppose we have a block $B'$ with an interlink stored as $B'.{\sf interlink}$. In order to produce the interlink for a block after $B'$ we make sure to change all pointers from level $0$ up to $level(B')$ to point to $B'$, as $B'$ will be the most recent block at these levels (remember that a block of level $\mu$ is also of level $\mu-1$). We call this procedure {\sf updateInterlink}, which can be seen in detail on Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow-interlink}.

\input{algorithms/alg.nipopow-interlink.tex}

\subsection{Suffix Proofs}
Suffix proofs are parameterized by $k$ and $m$. $k$ refers to the number of blocks that need to bury a block for it to be considered stable.

A suffix proof of a chain $\chain$ is constituted of two chains, $\pi$ and $\chi$. The final proof is the concatenation of those two chains $\pi \chi$. $\chi$ always refers to the chain of unstable blocks and is evaluated as $\chi = \chain[-k:]$.

The process for constructing $\pi$ is a little more convoluted. First we have to find the first level $\mu$ where $|\chain\upchain^\mu| \ge m$. We call this level $max\mu$. For this level we take all its blocks except for the last $m$: $\pi_{max\mu} = \chain\upchain^\mu[:-m]$. Then for every level $\mu$ from $max\mu - 1$ to $0$, we take blocks $\pi_\mu = \chain\upchain^\mu [:-m]\{\chain\upchain^{\mu+1}[-m]:\}$.

$\pi$ is then evaluated as the concatenation of all those chains starting from the oldest block:

$$ \pi = \pi_{max\mu} || \pi_{max\mu-1} || \ldots || \pi_0 $$

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/non-interactive-popow.pdf}
  \caption{Construction of $\pi$ of a suffix proof. $m=3$  Source:~\cite{nipopows}}
  \label{fig:suffix-proof}
\end{figure}

It's important to notice that the chain provided to the verifier is an actual chain: one can start at the end and traverse it until the genesis block by utilizing the interlink of each block, similar to how they would do that on a conventional blockchain by using each block's $\sf previd$.

\subsection{Infix Proofs}
\label{ssec:infix}
For the verifier to be able to determine a predicate on one or more blocks ($\chain' \subseteq \chain$) of our chain, we have to make sure we include them in a proof. A suffix proof is not guaranteed to include all blocks of interest in $\chain'$. In order to include these we have to make sure they are linked to the proof, e.g. that the proof chain is a traversable. To this end, let's assume some arbitrary block $B \in \chain'$. Let's also assume an existing suffix proof $\pi\chi$. We find blocks $E'$ and $E$ on the suffix proof, such that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $E$ is the next block after $E'$ on the proof
  \item $B$ comes before $E$ on $\chain$
  \item $B$ comes after $E'$ on $\chain$
\end{itemize}

An example of such a triplet of blocks satisfying those conditions can be seen on Figure~\ref{fig:infix-proof}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/infix.pdf}
  \caption{Construction of an infix proof.  Source:~\cite{nipopows}}
  \label{fig:infix-proof}
\end{figure}

We then perform a procedure called $\sf followDown$ in order to figure out which blocks need to be added to the proof in order to link $E$ to $B$. $\sf followDown$ includes blocks on intermediate levels until $B$ is reached. The full algorithm can be seen on Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow-infix-follow}.

\input{algorithms/alg.nipopow-infix-follow.tex}

Augmenting the original suffix proof with the new blocks provided by $\sf followDown$ on all our blocks of interest $B \in \chain'$ gives us our final infix proof. Note that as was the case with our suffix proofs, the infix proof is traversable.

\subsection{Velvet Forks}
Velvet forks~\cite{nipopows,velvet} describe a formalization of adding arbitrary data inside blocks in order to allow potential applications without sacrificing the backwards compatibility of the blockchain.

Miners who are willing to contribute to the fork can add data of interest in the form of coinbase transaction data. 

Backwards compatibility is achieved by not changing the consensus rules, meaning that set of acceptable blocks does not change. So any block that was acceptable remains acceptable even if it does not contain any data concerning the fork, or if it contains invalid data.

\subsection{User-Activated Velvet Forks}
In case miners aren't interested in including such data, users can also create such a fork by making a kind of transaction called velvet transaction. In a velvet transaction a user includes any data of interest in unspendable transaction outputs (like OP\_RETURN).

For the consumer of such data, the only difference is that they have to look inside the whole block to find it, not only inside the coinbase data.

Such forks come at the cost of making such transactions, because the user who makes the fork needs to pay transaction fees every time they wish to add data to the blockchain.

For our application, we implemented a User-Activated Velvet Fork in order to add the interlink data structure to Bitcoin Cash blocks. Since Bitcoin Cash has very low fees, a projection of running such a fork comes at around 10€/month.
