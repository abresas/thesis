\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we examine the real-world applications of the recent blockchain
  primitive called Non Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work (NIPoPoWs). We
  enable the use of the primitive on Bitcoin Cash by implementing the first
  known velvet fork on a blockchain. We provide concrete implementations for
  creating a velvet fork, and generating proofs on a blockchain that has been
  forked in this way.

In 2017 Bitcoin faced severe scalability issues. Its limited 1MB block size meant
that it could only support a maximum of 7 transactions per second. As Bitcoin's
popularity had exploded at the time, the problem was hugely exacerbated. The
most prominently proposed solution for this was a block size increase, however
no consensus was reached. The discussions ended with a fork of the main Bitcoin
chain which allowed for 8MB blocks, called Bitcoin Cash.
