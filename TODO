Proof-of-Work
abstract:
    in this paper -> work
    mention crosschain transactions
    mention prover works on real bitcoin cash, live, generating proofs, knowing

bitcoin ideal:
* intro
* transactions
	value transfer
	1 input, 1 output
	how to spend
	output has pk, input has sig
	utxos
	can't half-spend an output
	output to many
	change
	many to one
	* script
* blocks

* abstract
* bib
* interlinker: blockset construction, savings in proofs of inclusion in interlinks
* prover: # probably not # concrete savings in one nipopow proof, interlink reuse
* conclusion (proof consumption): 
	* summary of our results
		we velvt forked bcash testnet, we made interlinker, prover, in production, 
	* consuming data
		now people can do: verifier, superlight clients, crosschain [cite powsidechains]
	* future work
		calculate concrete savings for block, velvet fork mainnet, interlink other important blockchains (EIP which will do that for ETH) (btc, eth, etc, monero, dash), smart contract verifier for crosschain [christoglou - not prod, not velvet-capable], interoperability with pos sidechains [possidechains]
* graphs for both mainnet and testnet
* creative commons in appendix
